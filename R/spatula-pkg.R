#' The \pkg{spatula} package
#'
#' Provides bindings of \linkS4class{Spatial} classes from the \pkg{sp} package
#' so that they work nicely with Bioconductor containers and conventions.
#' This aims to facilitate analysis of biological spatial data (e.g., spatial transcriptomics,
#' mass cytometry, various types of image analysis) within the Bioconductor framework.
#' Additional quality-of-life utilities are provided to make it easier to interact with such objects,
#' such as quick creation of various types of \linkS4class{SpatialPolygons}.
